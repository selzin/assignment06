      A couple of frames is given and it is asked to decompose in blocks of variable size the
      absolute value of the frame difference according to a quad-tree structure. The threshold for
      splitting is fixed at 0.2 of the maximum of the absolute difference. Give the decomposition
      and the resulting image. Maximum block size is the whole image and the minimum is 4 x
      4. How many bits are needed for encoding the quad-tree?
      Then it is asked to do the same decomposition, but after estimating the motion vector
      of the variable size blocks by block matching, according to the quad-tree structure. Find
      the average value of the absolute displaced frame difference after motion compensation for
      all pixels lying in blocks with non-zero motion vector.
      The work report and the results should be given in HTML.
      Useful Matlab functions : qtdecomp, qtgetblk, qtsetblk.
